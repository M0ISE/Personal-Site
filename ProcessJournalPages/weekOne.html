        In the tutorial we did a lot of different sketching exercises to unpack and to kinda redefine how we think about sketching, that it’s a tool for thinking, communicating and persuading. The last part of the three was the one that I thought of
        being the most interesting. I’d never thought of it being a persuasive method. But it makes sense, it’s a tool to encode meaning and value. I thought that was a really helpful way of thinking.

        I liked designing the buttons and thinking through the different accessibility issue with each one. An encouragement. To not just have a super specialised button that only fulfils only one task. But have a product that can be multi-purpose.
        The Designing a microwave for ids was interesting. I wanted to try and design a microwave that fulfilled the needs of what a kid needs, but also be a good microwave in general, Kinda thinking about the button example. So I make a computer
        vision and Ai powered in bench microwave with voice controls, which was fun I thought.
