        A hectic week. So, I conducted my research, and synthesised all together and present. Which I guess is the important stuff.

        The research was good. My surveys went really well, I got 77 responses, and I didn't even have to pay anyone for them. It was really a bit of a blessing and a curse. I had so much useful data, but the more data, the more time it takes to
        analyse it. Interviews were fine, I got to talk to a good range of people and see and tease out their thoughts. The observation was funny and a failure. I went out to a community garden and waited for 90mins, and no one was there to talk to
        which was quite sad for me, having to sit and wait for nothing. But I guess I should have realised that my user group aren't unemployed uni students just waiting at community gardens.

        But my findings were really fascinating. I kinda disproved what I went to find out. I discovered that there is more of a freshness community rather than there is a big organic community. No one doesn’t value the freshness of their food;
        Everyone wants freshness, but the cost is a limiter. Everyone wants Quality, but that’s moderated by convenience and price. These were the tow tensions that I found that governs peoples freshness choices. Pictured below.
