      So, this was my semester 2 of my design computing degree in 2018. I’ve logged my process in designing stuff for this subject, and hopefully, it all makes sense. It was interesting for me to look back at it all. Hopefully it’s interesting for you all well.

          I feel like this semester I’ve worked less as a constant unified design process week after week and more of design sprints. Smaller moments of intense work that move the projects ahead a lot.  I think for next time I should work more in a process and leave more time for interaction and allowing ideas to form for naturally and in a less stressed environment. Though there were definitely some unforeseen stuff that came up over this sem, so maybe my critique is a little undue.  I’ve deftly grown as a designer, and I think I’m a lot of intentional with my sketching and wireframing as well as built on my web design abilities. Also, this whole journal is good, when there issue much work to do, I tent to have a bit of a tunnel vision for the next, and this definitely helps to expand that just a little bit.
